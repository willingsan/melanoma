# Melanoma Detection Using CNN

CNN based model is required to accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that needs to be detected early to avoid fatality. The current project is being done to provide a model that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## General Information

Melanoma accounts for 75% of skin cancer related deaths. This solution analyzes images and classifies them as potential case of Melanoma or otherwise. This reduces manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Project Statement

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. To build a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow.

## Technologies Used

Python 3.x, 
Tensorflow 2.16
Keras 3
Google Colab
Google Drive

## Conclusions

- Solutions accuracy is nearly 83% on validation set
- There is some overfitting, but it reduces with increased epoch
- The model may also be improved with hyperparameter tuning
- The model's accuracy can be further improved if we get larger dataset for training and testing
